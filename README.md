## Gaussian Blur
- Gaussian blur known as Gaussian smoothing is the result of blurring an image by a gaussian function. It is typically used for reducing image  noise and reducing detail. 
- Mathematically, applying a Gaussian blur to an image is the same as convolving the image with Gaussian function.
- Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, applying a Guassian blur has the effect of reducing the imageâ€™s high-frequency components; at same time, a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter.  
- A box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is a spatial domain linear filter in which each pixel in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of its neighboring pixels in the input image. It is a form of low-pass ("blurring") filter. A 3 by 3 box blur can be written as 1/9 * determinant matrix:
